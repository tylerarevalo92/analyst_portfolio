# Healthcare Analytics Portfolio

A portfolio of business analyst projects in **PostgreSQL**, **Tableau**, and **Excel**.  
This repository showcases my ability to work with real-world healthcare datasets, perform data cleaning and transformation, and create insights through visualizations and dashboards.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
Healthcare analytics plays a critical role in improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and driving data-driven decision making.  
This portfolio highlights end-to-end data work, including:

- **Database Setup & Management**: Running PostgreSQL in Docker for a clean, reproducible environment.  
- **Data Exploration**: Using DBeaver for SQL development, schema design, and dataset exploration.  
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaning and transforming CMS public healthcare datasets (e.g., Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program).  
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Building dashboards in Tableau Public and creating reports in Excel.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Completed Work
- Set up **PostgreSQL** inside Docker for a local development environment.  
- Connected the database to **DBeaver** and imported CMS HRRP dataset:  
  - Columns: Facility Name, Facility ID, State, Measure Name, Discharges, Readmission Ratios, Rates, etc.  
  - Cleaned data (handling `N/A` values, parsing dates, converting numeric fields).  
- Verified and prepared dataset for analysis in SQL.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ In Progress
- Designing **SQL queries** to explore key healthcare questions:  
  - Which Arizona hospitals have the highest/lowest excess readmission ratios?  
  - How do predicted vs expected readmission rates compare across measures?  
  - Are there trends by condition (AMI, HF, PN, etc.) over time?  
- Exporting cleaned datasets for visualization.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Planned Work
- **Tableau Dashboards (Public Profile)**  
  - Dashboard 1: Readmission rates in Arizona vs national averages  
  - Dashboard 2: Hospital-level comparisons by condition  
  - Dashboard 3: Trend analysis of predicted readmission rates (2020â€“2023)  

- **Excel Reports**  
  - Summary tables and pivot charts for healthcare quality metrics  
  - Supplementary visuals to highlight insights  

- **Additional Datasets (Future Expansion)**  
  - Medicare Spending per Beneficiary  
  - Hospital Compare (quality ratings, mortality, safety)  
  - Healthcare Costs by Condition  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Dockerized)  
- **SQL IDE**: DBeaver  
- **Visualization**: Tableau Public, Excel  
- **Languages**: SQL (Postgres), Excel formulas/pivots

## ðŸ”¹ Portfolio Goals
This portfolio demonstrates:
- SQL proficiency in cleaning, transforming, and analyzing healthcare data.  
- Ability to design and publish professional dashboards in Tableau.  
- Analytical skills applied to real-world healthcare quality metrics.  
- A reproducible workflow using open datasets and open-source tools.
